# Angular Learning Journey & Final Project

## Overview
This repository contains my day-by-day learning progress in Angular and my **final project**: an Event Planning Web Application. It demonstrates my understanding of Angular concepts from basics to advanced topics, and how I applied them to build a real-world application.

---

## Learning Progress
I documented and practiced all Angular topics day by day, including:
- Components, Templates, and Data Binding
- Directives and Pipes
- Services and Dependency Injection
- Routing and Navigation
- Forms (Template-driven and Reactive)
- HTTP Client and API Integration
- State Management
- Observables and RxJS
- Module Architecture and Lazy Loading
- Deployment best practices

Each folder/file in this repository corresponds to the topics or exercises I completed on a particular date.

## Final Project: Event Planning Web App
**Description:**  
A full-featured event planning web application that allows users to create, manage, and RSVP to events. The project showcases my ability to build dynamic, responsive, and interactive applications using Angular.

**Key Features:**
- User registration and login
- Event creation and editing
- Event browsing and search
- RSVP and attendee management
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Integration with backend APIs (mock or real)

**Technologies Used:**
- Angular (all core concepts)
- TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- Angular Router & Forms
- Observables and RxJS for asynchronous operations

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with Angular architecture and best practices
- Learned to structure a project and maintain modular, reusable code
- Applied Angular knowledge to build a real-world web application
